1) git init --> initialse the git
2) ls -lart --> shows all the hidden files present in the folder.
3) git status --> to see the status of files

** Few Important Concepts **
** Untracked --> git is not tracking the file
** staging --> add file to the place where git start tracking the changes
** Unmodified --> it means you have commit the file from staging area and git 				  took the snapshort of it.


4) git commit -m "initial comment"
5) git checkout <file name> --> this will bring back the last changed version 								of file.

6) git log --> provide the logs of commits
7) git diff --> compare file from staging area with working directory (unstaged 				files, on which you are working currently)
8) git diff --staged <filename> --> this will compare file with the staging 									area with the last commit.
9) git reset HEAD dummy.html
git checkout dummy.html  --> this will bring back the previous staged file.
							For example: if you staged the file, but you want the previous version now, use this command.
